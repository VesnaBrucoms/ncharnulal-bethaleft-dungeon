# Location Overview

Ncharnulal-Bethaleft was a Dwemer mining and research facility that was infrequently mentioned in the surviving
records, and its location thought to have been lost to the sands of time. However, X had recently thought to
have discovered its location and set out on an expedition, alone, to prove her theory correct. She found the
cave of A, hired a team of miners to dig through a section, which revealed a large cavern with a portion ruin of
Ncharulal-Bethaleft.

## Facility Purpose

Ncharnulal-Bethaleft was built to mine a special crystal in the area that has peculiar energy properties that the
Dwemer were interested in exploiting. Initial experiments revealed it could be an intense power source. As a
result the entire facility was automated and powered with this crystal. Many centurians were adapted and
augmented with it too.

### Mining & Processing

This massive section of the facility houses the mining efforts, crystal processing, and the all important power
plant containing the large generator that powers the entire facility.

#### Hall of Power

This is the central room in this section and is 3 stories tall and connects the mining and processing wings.
Each floor is largely open to the others barring some catwalks and pipes that criss-cross the space. Ground
floor contains the power plant, door to the cavern/expansion zone, door to mining to the left, door to processing
to the right, and stairs to the 2nd floor opposite the entrance door.

On the 2nd floor a catwalked rail system for ore runs across the room from mining to processing, serving as
the primary feed into it. This sits closer to the expansion zone. Both wings open up to this floor (for
sending & receiving), but they do not bridge over.

On the 3rd floor both wings also open up here and they connect with a chain corridor that opens to a round
room in the centre. This room contains one of the large crystals required to power the power plant, but is
inaccesible until both wings are sufficiently powered with their backup generators.

#### Crystal Mining

A set of rooms that opens up to a cavern with many depleted containers of the crystal. However, throughout
the PC can find several raw crystals that can be processed in the other wing. The generator in this section
only requires one crystal to get it running to unlock the 3rd floor, but providing another unlocks a store
room with loot.

#### Crystal Processing

**Gist:** An easier wing that's primary goal is to provide utility (the cutting) and orientation with the
puzzle mechanic. This will be either the first or the second location the PC visits, as going to mining first
will mean picking up raw crystals, but no way to use them until cut.

A smaller wing with a couple of cut crystals to find, but it does contain the machine required to cut the raw
crystals the PC finds in mining. The primary dynamo is located to the southwest and it powers the cutting
machine, the door to HoP 2F, door to upper proc. A switch turns that off to allow access to maintenance. A
second dynamo is above and north of the cutting machines, and provides the second power to upper proc.

This section is largely free of enemies apart from a spider by the primary dynamo and a sphere chute in recieving
that activates only when the primary dynamo is switched to upstairs.

Items:
* cut crystals
  * 1 by cutting machines
  * 1 in recieving room
* coins
  * 2 by primary dynamo
  * 3 by secondary dynamo
* goblets
  * 1 by primary dynamo

Containers
* barrels in recieving room
* Chest by secondary dynamo

### Living Quarters & Research

The other section of NB was dedicated to living quarters and research. Here the more specific and esoteric uses
of the crystal were discovered and put to use. Including the more powerful centurians guarding this section of
the ruin.

#### Halls of Knowledge

## Absuri-Dur

Short-ish cavern in the Molag Amur region with two small rooms and a massive cavity containing the expansion zone
for the ruin.

Enter into a tunnel that splits into two directions. Going left leads to a kagouti nest, while right takes you to
another small room with evidence of camping and mining activity. From here it leads into a corridor that goes down
and into a massive cavity. At the bottom are the exposed ruins of Ncharnulal-Bethaleft and X and her mining team,
working to power the entrance. A set of scaffolding has been assembled to take the PC down to about half way,
and from there is a natural path. Taking you under a waterfall and over a stream that disappears into the inky
blackness.

## Current State

With much of the fuel run dry (at least that's visible and easily accessible), X has had to make do with jury
rigging and scavenging to get parts of the ruin powered for exploration. PC enters the cavern at the point X
has fixed and plugged in one generator and is preparing to power it to open the way into the mining and
processing section. Providing a **teaching moment** to show the PC how to use the crystals and generators, as well
as what the powered and unpowered states look like.

Inside it's largely unpowered, requiring the PC to gradually find crystals to power the
various generators to, in turn, power doors and other functions.

The PC's actions will result in the ruin becoming noisier and brighter, but also more dangerous as the
automatons and other security functions come to life.

Large crystals are required to power the main generator to open the way to the rest of the ruin.
